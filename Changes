Revision history for Perl extension Image::Timeline.

0.11  Wed Feb 25 22:28:12 CST 2004

 - Images are now written uwing binmode() on the output filehandle,
   which makes a difference on platforms like Win32. [Pa'll I'so'lfur
   O'lason]

 - Added 'right_margin' parameter, which allows the user to define
   some extra space in the right of the picture so that the last
   legend isn't cut in the final image. [Paulo Jorge Jesus Silva]

 - Added 'to_string' parameter, which allows the user to define the
   function used to convert the numerical value of a date into a
   string. [Paulo Jorge Jesus Silva]

0.08  Wed Jul  9 12:11:47 CDT 2003

 - Apparently the "better way" from release 0.07 didn't work for
   everybody, so there's yet *another* change in the testing for
   it.

0.07  Tue Jul  8 17:56:19 CDT 2003

 - Found a better way to test whether GD was compiled with support for
   GIFs.  Now we don't fail a couple tests (we skip them) when GIFs
   aren't supported. [Reported by Gene Boggs]

0.06  Tue Jul  8 17:10:11 CDT 2003

 - Skip the 'date_format.t' test if Date::Format isn't installed.

 - Document the interface to write(), which allows rendering in any
   format supported by GD.

0.05  Fri Aug 24 11:15:00 BST 2001
  - MZSANFORD@cpan.org helped add simple date support via the 'date_format' parameter.
  
  - 'bar_stepsize' can now be specified as a percentage of total data width

0.04  Mon Jun 18 01:56:24 CDT 2001
  - Forgot to include a file necessary for the 'make test' installation step.
    Added to MANIFEST.

0.03  Mon Jun 11 10:59:16 CDT 2001
  - Fixed a stray backslash in a string constant, which caused an 
    incompatibility with perl 5.7.1.

0.02  Jun  5 17:10 2001
  - Added a real test for PNG output, comparing generated data to 
    a sample output file.
